## Introduction

Welcome to our home delivery service! Using our advanced Java Spring Boot application and RabbitMQ messaging protocol, we can process orders quickly and efficiently, from the moment they are placed to delivery to your door.

this app provides a seamless experience for both customers and suppliers. Customers can easily select and order their favorite dishes through our user-friendly interface. Once an order is placed, it is immediately routed to our RabbitMQ system, which manages and prioritizes orders based on various criteria such as distance to the customer and supplier availability.

On the suppliers' side, they receive the orders assigned to their location in real time. Thanks to RabbitMQ, orders are distributed efficiently and suppliers can respond quickly, minimizing waiting time for customers.

This Java Spring Boot application provides a robust and scalable infrastructure, allowing us to easily handle a high volume of orders during peak hours. Furthermore, using RabbitMQ provides reliable communication between different parts of our system, ensuring consistency and reliability with every transaction.

In short, with our combination of Java Spring Boot and RabbitMQ we can provide a smooth and reliable home delivery service that meets the needs of both customers and suppliers. Thank you for choosing us for your culinary needs!
